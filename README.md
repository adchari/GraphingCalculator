# GraphingCalculator
A java based calculator application

A simple Java program made for a class

In truth, it is not truly a graphing calculator, as it cannot graph. 
The functions, including integrals, derivatives, and limits, are interesting to develop.
Graphing functionality is an interesting prospect. 

I have completed my work on this, so I wanted to see how the community could help develop the idea,
or how other CS students could use the code.
